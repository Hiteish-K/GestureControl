# GestureControl
GestureControl is a Python-based desktop tool that allows users to control their mouse and trigger system actions using only hand gestures detected via a webcam. Built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, and system tray integration, HawkEye brings a touchless and accessible interface to your fingertips quite literally.
